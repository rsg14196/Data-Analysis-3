# Data-Analysis-3
This report is designed on the foundation of text data modelling concepts. We are using word embeddings techniques like word2Vec model of genism module in python to convert the corpus into a set of vectors and identify the similarities and biasness of the data.

# DATASET
In the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election, a Russian "troll factory," the Internet Research Agency (IRA), is alleged to have deliberately sought to sow political discontent in the US with inflammatory social media content. Twitter reported to the US congress a list of thousands of Twitter handles associated to the IRA. So the data of all the tweets produced by these twitter accounts since 2012 in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets . In addition to the raw text content, several dimensions of meta data are provided.

# Two major questions that were supposed to be answered
Q1 How much bias can be identified in the language used in these tweets?
Q2 Does grouping the tweets by content similarity align with the labels (e.g., "RightTroll") that have been provided with the dataset?

# Implementation
NLTK and Gensim are used.
